## Game of Thrones Character Sentiment Analyzer

My friends and I were curious to see how Twitter reacted to Game of Thrones characters in real time during each episode in the last season. We used Tweepy to stream all tweets for a selected set of characters and passed each tweet to the sentiment analyzer TextBlob in order to get a sentiment score. We used react-trend to graph the data of the sentiment scores.

We went all out with the memes. A confetti of emojiâ€™s sprang out whenever the overall sentiment of a character changed. You could also press F to pay your respects for characters who died. 

I designed the site in Sketch and built the front-end. I also found a ton of funny gifs.
